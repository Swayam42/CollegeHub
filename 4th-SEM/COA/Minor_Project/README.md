# Scientific Calculator – Minor Project (COA, 4th Semester)

This folder contains the implementation of a **Scientific Calculator** developed as a **Minor Project** for the **Computer Organization and Architecture (COA)** subject in the 4th semester of our B.Tech (CSE) curriculum.

## 📌 Project Objective

- Fulfill the minor project requirement for COA.
- Strengthen understanding of ARM architecture and assembly-level programming.
- Gain practical experience in low-level computation and system-level coding.

## 🧠 Features

- Basic arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division  
- Scientific functions:  
  - Trigonometric (sin, cos, tan)  
  - Power and square root  
  - Logarithmic and exponential functions  
- Error handling for invalid inputs  
- Clean and readable ARM Assembly code structure
