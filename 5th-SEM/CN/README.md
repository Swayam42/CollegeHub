### [Lab 6: Subnetting and Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)](Labs/Lab6)

**Aim:**  
To implement subnetting and Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) in a network using Cisco Packet Tracer and verify communication across subnets.

**Objectives:**

1. Understand IPv4 addressing, CIDR notation, subnetting, and VLSM in an IPv4 network.
2. Assign subnet addresses to multiple LANs based on host requirements:
   - Using fixed-length subnets
   - Using VLSM
3. Configure routers and PCs in Cisco Packet Tracer.
4. Verify intra-subnet and inter-subnet communication using ping commands.

**Problem Statements:**

- **Part 1:** Design network using fixed-length subnetting for a company with network 172.16.0.0/24 divided into subnets with 40, 20, 10, and 5 hosts.
- **Part 2:** Design the same network using VLSM.

2. An overview on message communication between two end hosts using FTP packets.
3. Configuring a server device as DHCP server in a network that dynamically assigns IP addresses to client PCs and verifying the connectivity in the network using ping command.
4. Demonstrating the generation and verification of IP address using APIPA, when a host fails to obtain an IP address from a DHCP server.
5. Configuring a router (in the absence of a server) in a network that implements DHCP protocol for allocation of IP address to hosts dynamically and verifying the working of DHCP.
6. Configuring a client–server network using FTP server and analysing the message communication (packets) exchanged between the client and server.
